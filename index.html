            Founded in 2019 by Amelia Grace, The Book Cave has come a long way
            from its beginnings in New York. When Amelia Grace first started
            out, her passion for books drove her to do more research on how to
            open and run a business so that The Book Cave can offer you quality
            and every book there is to offer. We now serve customers all over
            the world, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into
            our own website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We hope you enjoy our books as much as we enjoy offering them to
            you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to
            contact us.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <br />
